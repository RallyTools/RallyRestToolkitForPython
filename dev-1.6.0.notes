/Users/kl683949/work/pyral has the current dev state as branch labeled 'forward-to-1.5.3'  <-- check to see if this is true... .
     the above has .git/config whose remote "origin" goes to klehman-rally/pyral
     which is the repo where things get worked on and prepped before merging them into the
     RallyTools/RallyRestToolkitForPython repo where the official release occurs as long as 
     I have a klehman-rally Github account.
     
have to set these things in your environment
   to be able to run tests

    working directory /Users/klehman/work/pyral

   use pyenv, get 3.11.x installed and use that as your target Python version for development

   # set up for use of pyenv
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"

   pyenv shell 3.11.x

   set these env vars:
      PYTHON=python3.11
      export PYTHONPATH="."
      PYTEST=/Users/klehman/.pyenv/versions/3.11.x/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pytest.py

potential changes include
   Added support for Objective, KeyResult, Risk entities as well as CapacityPlan related entities.
   Fixed issue with obtaining User entities via the Rally.getAllUsers method.
   Considering whether pyral will accommodate adding/retrieving Attachments with duplicated name.
       (Sagi and I worked on code in a testbed restapi.py (see the base directory...) that did part of this)
   Also, check on the code for turning any content for the AttachmentContent to a byte string of base64.base64encode'ed data.
       You can look at the AttachmentLinker class in wic-core/related_objects/rally_attachment_linker.py to see what is done there.

   fixed entity.py - class Persistable  def _hydrateRevisionHistory method
        there was a typo in line 202 that referred to 'RevisonHistory' instead of the correct 'RevisionHistory'

   adjust how a Rally class instance session.headers are assigned, adjusted to getting a copy of RALLY_REST_HEADERS
   this may have a beneficial effect when multiple Rally instances are used in a script.

   made an adjustment to getAllUsers so that it may work more properly

   search is no longer supported by WSAPI

Release Notes for 1.6.0

    Rally.search is no longer operational
