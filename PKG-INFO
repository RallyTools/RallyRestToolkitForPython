Description: This is the README file for pyral, a package implementing a 
        Pythonic interface to the Rally REST API
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        The Rally REST Tookit for Python consists of a package that provides a means
        to interact with entities and artifacts in your Rally subscription.  The full
        spectrum of CRUD operations is available in your Rally Workspaces and Projects,
        providing of course that your Rally subscription credentials enable you to perform
        those operations.  The toolkit insulates the package user from having to make
        multiple requests to obtain the full set of qualifying items by performing any 
        subsequent "page" requests automatically.
        An additional key feature is the ability to obtain entity sub fields
        that may be references or collections via the familiar dot '.' notation.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The pyral package requires the use of Kenneth Reitz's requests package using version 2.12.0 or better.
        As of requests version 2.0.0, there is support for HTTPS over HTTP proxy via the CONNECT request.
        The requests package can be found via the Python Package Index site (http://pypi/python.org/index).
        The most recent release of pyral (1.5.2) has been tested with requests 2.22.0.
        The six module is also required.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you want to pull down the latest release from standard Python package repository
        (pypi.python.org) and install the package, the easiest way is to use
        pip, the Python package installation utility.::
        
            pip install pyral
        
        Alternatively if you've got the tar.gz or zip distribution on hand, as long as you've
        satisfied the dependency requirements on the six and requests packages, you can use
        the setup mechanism.
        Once requests and six has been installed, run the setup.py program supplied with
        this distribution as::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Validation
        ----------
        
        Copy the template.cfg file to a file named my.cfg.
        Edit my.cfg.  Uncomment and replace the values for SERVER, USER, PASSWORD.
        Leave the WORKSPACE and PROJECT entries commented out for now.
        
        Run the rallyfire.py program as:
        
        $ python rallyfire.py --config=my.cfg
