Description: This is the README file for pyral, a package implementing a 
        Pythonic interface to the Agile Central (formerly Rally) REST API
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        The Rally REST Tookit for Python consists of a package that provides a means
        to interact with entities and artifacts in your Rally subscription.  The full
        spectrum of CRUD operations is available in your Agile Central (Rally) Workspaces and Projects,
        providing of course that your Agile Central (Rally) subscription credentials enable you to perform
         those operations.  The toolkit insulates the package user from having to make 
        multiple requests to obtain the full set of qualifying items by performing any 
        subsequent "page" requests automatically.  
        An additional key feature is the ability to obtain entity sub fields
        that may be references or collections via the familiar dot '.' notation.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The pyral package requires the use of Kenneth Reitz's requests package using version 2.8.0 or better.
        As of requests version 2.0.0, there is support for HTTPS over HTTP proxy via the CONNECT request.
        The requests package can be found via the Python Package Index site (http://pypi/python.org/index).
        The most recent release of pyral (1.2.4) has been tested with requests 2.8.1.
        The six module is also required.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Once requests and six has been installed, run the setup.py program supplied with
        this distribution as::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Validation
        ----------
        
        Copy the template.cfg file to a file named my.cfg.
        Edit my.cfg.  Uncomment and replace the values for SERVER, USER, PASSWORD.
        Leave the WORKSPACE and PROJECT entries commented out for now.
        
        Run the rallyfire.py program as:
        
        $ python rallyfire.py --config=my.cfg
